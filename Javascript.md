# HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

### <html>
CONTENT LAYER
. html files
This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML 
gives the page structure and adds semantics.

### {css}
PRESENTATION LAYER
. css files
The CSS enhances the HTML
page with rules that state how
the HTML content is presented
(backgrounds, borders, box
dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.)

### javascript()
BEHAVIOR LAYER
.js files
This is where we can change
how the page behaves, adding
interactivity. We will aim to keep
as much of our JavaScript as
possible in separate files.

## Statements 
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a **statement**.
Statements should end with a semicolon.

- STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND
EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE
