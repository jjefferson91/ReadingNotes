## Version Control
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.

Save you place and also lets you revisit previous saves making it easy to fix past mistakes.
- Local Version Control 
one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
- Centralized Version Control
collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files
- Distributed Version Control
a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

**Git** - a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit.

Git's are like save points in video games. If you mess up you can go back. Helps prevent losing data and will detect corrupt data as well.\

Three main states files in Git can reside in
1. Committed (securely stored)
2. Modified (changed but not committed)
3. Staged (ready to be committed)

**git config** allows the setting of configuration variables that control aspects of Git’s operation and look.\
To check settings, use the **git config --list** command
**git add* 
**git commit**
**git push**
**git stash**
