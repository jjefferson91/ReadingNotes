#The ABC of Programming

*What is a script? and how to make one? 
A **script** is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.

`Think of them as step-by-step instructions for your computer.` 

Nothing is set in stone using scripts, different paths can be chosen depending on the user.

## Writing a Script
1. **Define The Goal**.
 What  task do you need the computer tk achieve?
2. **Design The Script**
Break down the goal into steps. A series of task  containing all individual steps needed to complete the goal.
3. **Code Each Step**
Write each step into a programming language.
`example pg. 18 of Duckett Javascript`
## Writing Code
The first 2 things you need to know before writing code is;
 1. **Vocabulary** Words that computers understand

2. **Syntax** How you use those words to create instructions your PC can understand.

## Expressions & Operators
*What is an **expression**?*
 An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. 

 - Expressions that assign a direct value to a variable.
 - Expressions that use multiple values to return a single value.

 **Expressions** rely on **Operators**

**Operators** perform some sort of operation and produces a result. They're different types of operators as well.

- Arithmetic Operators
- String Operators

## Functions
*What is a function?*
Function lets you group a series of statements together to proform a specific task.

The name of the function should describe the task it's performing. **Calling** the function is when you ask the system to perform the task.

Piecea of information passed to a fuction are known as **parameters**.

An answer provided from a function is called a **return value**.
