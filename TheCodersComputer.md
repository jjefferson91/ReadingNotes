## Text Editors

*Choosing a text editor*

What is a text editor?
  Software tool that allows you to write and manage text, assists in building websites.

What type of operation system your using can play big role in choosing a text editor but most are similiar.

Preinstalled software includes:
"Text Edit" "Notepad" "Gedit"

`No matter what use plain text when writing code with text editor that comes installed.`

Third-Party Options are much more customizable prodiving theme's and shortcut options. Examples include:
- Notepad++
- TextWrangler
- BB Edit
- Video Studio Code
- Atom

These options all prodive different ways of clarifying, highlighting, and organizing work.

#### IDE (Intergrated Development Enviornment)

An **IDE** differs fromna text editor best it does so much more. 
An **IDE** is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package

## Command line/Terminal
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. I like to think of it as talking to my computer.

! [example] <img width="437" alt="Screenshot 2021-03-17 210522" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80726468/111562871-eac21780-8764-11eb-9352-103f1ceca63b.png">

Line 1 shows command with an option and argument. Lines 2 shows the resulting output. Line 6 is our prompt lets us know our terminal is ready for another command.

Shortcuts like Ctrl + Shift + 3 helps me opening my Ubuntu terminal or using arrow keys to navigate through the terminal.

## Basic Navigation

**pwd** (print/present working directory) 
**ls** - current location 

**Absolute paths** specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )

**Relative paths** specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.

**cd** (change directory) *ran with no arguements takes you back to home screen*
allows you to move around in the system.
