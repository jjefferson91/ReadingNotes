# CSS
*What is CSS and what does it do?*

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets** and is the digital launguage for designing various visual aspects of a web document (Colors, borders, fonts, layout).

`CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements`

A rule contains both **Selectors** (selects elements to affect [Duckett: HTML & CSS pg. 238]) and **Declarations** (decides how element will be styled.)
- Declarations are 2 parts; property and a value seperated by a colon.
- Select multiple selectors by seperating with a comma.
//example on page 231 of Duckett: HTML & CSS ,elements are < p > < h1 > < h2 > 

**Properties** indicate the aspect you want to change (color, font, border)
**Values** specifies the settings you have designated to change.

- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Color
The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways

- RGB Value (rgb(100,100,90))
- Hex Codes (#ee3e80)
- Color Names (red, DarkGrey)

## Contrast

When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

`Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.`
